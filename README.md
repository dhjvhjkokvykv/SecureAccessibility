# SecureAccessibility

<b>Accessibility services or password-on-boot encryption? Pick both!</b>

SecureAccessibility allows you to use accessibility services while still keeping that password-on-boot screen enabled!

If your password-on-boot screen is currently disabled, you will have to reactivate it for SecureAccessibility to work.

Compatible with all versions newer than Kitkat (4.4) including Lolipop (5.0/5.1) and Marshmallow (6.0).
*It should theoretically work on Nougat (7.0) too!*

If you find a bug, please create an issue in the Github issue tracker and post your logcat + Xposed logs.

<b>NOT TESTED on heavily modified ROMS (Touchwiz, LG, EMUI, etc...)</b>

<u>Accessibility services and password-on-boot do not work together for a reason. By using this Xposed module, you maybe compromising your phone's security.<u>
